# Reddit-data-scraping:
To get started, first visit https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps and create a new Reddit API application.
Once you've created it, you'll be provided with a Client ID and Client Secret. Save those credentials in your code like this: 
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID = "your_client_id"   ,
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET = "your_client_secret"
After you've set those values, you're ready to run the code.
